    "# Q1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios is it preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is part of the family of non-relational databases. Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and offer flexible schemas. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL databases), NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, and they are often more scalable and suitable for handling large amounts of data with diverse structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenarios where MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large amounts of data with varying structures.\n",
    "Projects that require horizontal scalability and distribution of data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "Agile development environments where schema changes are frequent.\n",
    "Applications that benefit from the flexibility of a document-based data model (JSON-like documents).\n",
    "# Q2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Schema: MongoDB doesn't require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic and evolving data models.\n",
    "Document-Oriented: Data is stored in BSON (Binary JSON)-like documents, which can contain arrays and other documents.\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB can scale horizontally by sharding data across multiple servers or nodes.\n",
    "Indexing: Supports efficient indexing to improve query performance.\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: Provides powerful aggregation and data processing capabilities.\n",
    "Replication: Supports replica sets for high availability and data redundancy.\n",
    "Ad Hoc Queries: Supports rich and expressive queries.\n",
    "GridFS: A specification for storing large files, such as images or videos.\n",
    "# Q3: Write code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "      # Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Create a database\n",
    "mydb = client[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Create a collection (similar to a table in relational databases)\n",
    "mycollection = mydb[\"mycollection\"]\n",
    "# Q4: Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "       # Insert one record\n",
    "record_one = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "mycollection.insert_one(record_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Insert many records\n",
    "records_many = [\n",
    "     {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"London\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Paris\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "mycollection.insert_many(records_many)\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Find and print one record\n",
    "result_one = mycollection.find_one({\"name\": \"John\"})\n",
    "print(result_one)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Find and print all records\n",
    "result_many = mycollection.find()\n",
    "for record in result_many:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "# Q5: Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The find() method is used to query data from a MongoDB collection. It returns a cursor, which can be iterated to retrieve documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "    # Find documents where age is greater than 30\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 30}}\n",
    "result = mycollection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "for record in result:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "# Q6: Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort() method is used to sort the results of a query in MongoDB. It takes a field or fields by which to sort the documents and an optional direction (ascending or descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "    # Sort documents by age in descending order\n",
    "result_sorted = mycollection.find().sort(\"age\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "for record in result_sorted:\n",
    "    print(record)\n",
    "# Q7: Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_one(filter): Deletes a single document that matches the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "delete_many(filter): Deletes all documents that match the specified filter criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop(): Drops the entire collection, including all its documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are used to remove documents or collections from the database. delete_one() and delete_many() are more targeted, allowing selective removal based on specified criteria. drop() is more drastic, as it removes the entire collection."
